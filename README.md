#  Trampoline Routine Calculator (Client)
The frontend for my app that helps gymnasts calculate difficulty and “FIG Shorthand” for routines performed on Trampolines. It's built with create-react-app, MaterialUI, Zustand and uses the browser fetch API for data. This app is designed to be hosted directly by the backend as opposed to on a CDN like Vercel and has been mostly ported over from an original version built with NextJS.
